# Introduction
Welcome everyone to my project. This project serves as a platform for me to refine and showcase the skills and tools I use, essential for my work in the field of Data. It's an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency and capability in handling data-related tasks.

Firstly, I would like to introduce the Customer Onboarding project. This project simulates the real-world scenario of a bank implementing a digital introduction process for customers using eKYC technology. This process includes customers undergoing an introduction, creating a digital account, and performing transactions. "Customer Onboarding" is the process of approaching and welcoming new customer entities. This process aims to ensure that customers can easily access the bank's products and services beforehand. The project focuses on this process, which is the crucial initial stage in the relationship between the bank and the customer. Therefore, understanding and analyzing data related to this process are extremely important to ensure the best customer experience. 

My project is divided into four main cases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Customer Onboarding process:
## [Case 1 - Data model Design:](https://github.com/baoan102/Customer-Onboading/tree/main/Case%201%20-%20Data%20Model%20Design)
In this case, I will delve into the customer journey from their initial interaction with the service to performing transactions. The focus will be on designing a suitable data model that ensures flexibility and scalability. I will study data requirements, identify entities and their relationships, and establish rules and standards for data collection and storage.
## [Case 2 â€“ Metadata, Security and Quality:](https://github.com/baoan102/Customer-Onboading/tree/main/Case%202%20-%20Metadata%20-%20Security%20and%20Quality)
In this case, I will explore metadata management to ensure data security and quality. I will identify critical data attributes, validate data integrity and consistency, and establish security measures to ensure that customer information is protected effectively.
## [Case 3 - Reporting and Analytics:](https://github.com/baoan102/Customer-Onboading/tree/main/Case%203%20-%20Reporting%20and%20Analytics)
In this case, I will focus on generating reports and analyzing data related to the Customer Onboarding process. I will apply data analysis tools and methods to extract valuable insights and make meaningful observations. This will help the bank gain a better understanding of customers and improve the Onboarding process.
## [Case 4 - Fraud Predictive Model:](https://github.com/baoan102/Customer-Onboading/tree/main/Case%204%20-%20Fraud%20Predictive%20Model)
In the final case, I will create a fraud prediction model. By analyzing data related to the Onboarding process, I will build a classification model to identify potential fraudulent behaviors. This will enable the bank to detect suspicious signs promptly and implement effective preventive measures.
##
My Customer Onboarding project is a challenging step to demonstrate my data analysis skills, model design capabilities, data quality assurance, and the ability to generate useful insights to support decision-making. Through this project, I hope to prove my ability to apply these skills to optimize the Onboarding process and provide a better experience for customers.
